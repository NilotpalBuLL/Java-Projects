# ☕ Java Projects

This repository is a collection of my *Java-based projects* built during my learning journey and internship tasks.  
Each project demonstrates different concepts of *Java programming* such as *OOP, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, file handling, data structures, and more*.
## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Strengthen understanding of *Core Java*  
- Apply *Object-Oriented Programming* concepts  
- Build small but functional systems step by step  
- Practice *problem solving* and *code reusability*
